#### Introduction

> Books allow us to discover fantasy worlds and be er understand the world we live in.
  They enable us to learn about everything from photography to compilers ... and of
  course a good book is a great way to relax!
  Google Books is a project that embraces the value books bring to our daily lives.
  It aspires to bring the world's books online and make them accessible to everyone. In the
  last 15 years, Google Books has collected digital copies of 40 million books in more
  than 400 languages, partly by scanning books from libraries and publishers all around
  the world.
  In this competition problem, we will explore the challenges of setting up a scanning
  process for millions of books stored in libraries around the world and having them
  scanned at a scanning facility.
