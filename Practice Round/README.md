#### Introduction

> You are organizing a Hash Code hub and want to order pizza for your hubâ€™s participants.
> Luckily, there is a nearby pizzeria with really good pizza.
> The pizzeria has different types of pizza, and to keep the food offering for your hub interesting, you can only order at most one pizza of each type.
> Fortunately, there are many types of pizza to choose from!
> Each type of pizza has a specified size: the size is the number of slices in a pizza of this type.
> You estimated the maximum number of pizza slices that you want to order for your hub based on the number of registered participants.
> In order to reduce food waste, your goal is to order as many pizza slices as possible, but not more than the maximum number.
